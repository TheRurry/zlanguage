Paragraph: 11
Problem: It is not clear whether we can omit both the start and end indices in sequence slicing, like "foo = bar[:]".
Our Solution: This is possible in many other languages that support list slicing (like Python), so our compiler accepts this syntax.

Paragraph: 14
Problem: It is ambiguous whether a parameter list can be empty.
Our Solution: In the end, we allowed a parameter list to be empty due to other popular languages such as Java allowing the same.

Paragraph: 17
Problem: It is ambiguous of whether declaring a variable without assigning a value is allowed. For instance, “a : int;”.
Our Solution: Due to other popular languages such as C allowing for declarations without assignments, we have decided to allow this as well. 

Paragraph: 20
Problem: It is not clear whether or not the main function should contain the keyword return, or be allowed it and just be able to return no value.
Our Solution: Like other popular language we allow the main function to contain the return keyword, and allow return to be used as follows: return;.
